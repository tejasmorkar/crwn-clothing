## Credits

1. This project is a part of [Complete React Developer in 2021 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course on Udemy by [Andrei Neagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie) and [Yihua Zhang](https://github.com/ZhangMYihua)

2. I created the CI/CD pipeline on Azure DevOps after watching [this video](https://youtu.be/aMO-NQ1Xza0) on YouTube which is not up to date but gives a clear idea on what to do

3. Deploying a React App can be frustrating sometimes due to the client-routing errors, but the [official create-react-app documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) can make it a piece of cake
